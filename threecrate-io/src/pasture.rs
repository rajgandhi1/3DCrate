//! Pasture-based point cloud format support
//!
//! This module provides support for various point cloud formats through the pasture library,
//! including LAS, LAZ, PCD, and other formats.
//!
//! NOTE: This is currently a stub implementation. Full pasture integration requires
//! more complex API handling that will be implemented in future versions.
